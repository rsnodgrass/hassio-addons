Microservice exposing a REST interface for communicating with multi-zone audio
controllers and amplifiers (aka matrix audio). Initially this supports variations
of Xantech's original RS232 serial control protocol.

## Required Hardware
 
* multi-zone/matrix amplifier or controller that supports variations of the Xantech RS232 serial protocol (see below)
* host machine with a serial cable or network serial adapter to physically connect to a Xantech supported multi-zone amplifier/controller
* host machine for executing the Docker container (e.g. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) running Home Assistant's [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) hypervisor)

#### Supported Amplifiers/Controllers

| Manufacturer | Model(s)                 | Zones | Supported | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |:-----:|:---------:| ----- |
| Xantech      | MRAUDIO8X8 / MRAUDIO8X8m | 6+2   | YES       | audio only; zones 7-8 are preamp outputs only |
|              | MX88a / MX88ai           | **8** | YES       | audio only; ai = Ethernet support (MRIP) |
|              | MRC88 / MRC88m           | 6+2   | YES       | audio + video; zones 7-8 are preamp outputs only |
|              | MX88 / MX88vi            | **8** | YES       | audio + video; vi = Ethernet support (MRIP) |
|              | MRAUDIO4X4 / BXAUDIO4x4  | 4     | *NO*      | audio only; 4-zone uses different protocol |
|              | MRC44 / MRC44CTL         | 4     | *NO*      | audio + video; 4-zone uses different protocol |
|              | CM8X8 / CM8X8DR          | 8     | *MAYBE*   | commercial rack mount matrix controller (BNC) |
| Monoprice    | MPR-SG6Z / 10761         | 6     | *MAYBE*   | audio only; mid-fi version of Xantech |
| Dayton Audio | DAX66                    | 6     | *MAYBE*   | audio only; mid-fi version of Xantech |
| Anthem       | MDX-8                    | 4     | *NO*      | RS232 specification available, but not yet implemented |
| Anthem       | MDX-16                   | 8     | *NO*      | RS232 specification available, but not yet implemented |

* The [Monoprice MPR-SG6Z](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=10761) and
  [Dayton Audio DAX66](https://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-dax66-6-source-6-room-distributed-whole-house-audio-system-with-keypads-25-wpc--300-585)
  appear to have licensed or copies the serial interface from Xantech. Both Monoprice
  and Dayton Audio use a version of the Xantech multi-zone controller protocol.

* Some Xantech MX88 models use DB15 outputs on the rear, requiring a DB15 to DB9 adapter cable (PN 05913665). The pinouts of 05913665 are not currently documented ([possibly DB15-DB9 modem cable](https://www.aggsoft.com/rs232-pinout-cable/modem-db9-to-db15.htm)). These Xantech models have a DB9 RS232 port on the front which can also be used.

While some amplifiers (e.g. Xantech and Monoprice) support expanding the number of zones
by connecting two (or three) amplifiers together, the *Matrix Audio Bridge* enables
an "unlimited" number of amplifiers to be controlled via a REST interface, of any model.

## Installation

#### Install as a Docker Container

While this is called a Hass.io Add-on, that is merely semantic packaging around a Docker container,
which can also be executed directly.

```bash
docker build -t matrix-audio-bridge .
```

#### Install as a Hass.io Add-on

1. In the Hass.io "Add-On Store" on your Home Assistant server, add this repository URL:
<pre>
     https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hassio-addons
</pre>

2. Find the "Multi-Zone Audio Bridge" in the list of add-ons and click Install

## Configuration

The zone and source names are optionally configurable on the Multi-Zone Audio Bridge
as opposed to on the client side (like in Home Assistant configuration) since there may
be multiple clients that are accessing the Bridge's APIs, for instance a standalone
Alexa, SmartThings, iOS, Apple Watch integrations or directly via a browser. This reduces
the configuration and setup required across multiple client integrations.

```json
{ 
   "zone_names": {
      "1": "Living Room",
      "2": "Kitchen",
      "3": "Master Bedroom",
      "4": "Master Bathroom",
      "5": "Home Theater",
      "6": "Kids Room",
      "7": "Garage",
      "8": "Patio"
   }
}
```

## REST Interface 

#### Command Line Interaction

Show details for zone 1:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/xantech/zones/1
```

Response:

```json
```

Mute zone 4:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/xantech/zones/4/mute/on
```

# Client Registry

Known clients which interface with the Multi-Zone Audio Bridge:

* [Multi-Zone Audio Control add-on](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-integrations/tree/master/custom_components/xantech_mza) for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io)

# Not Yet Implemented

#### Priority

* ability to remote configure or rename zones/sources via the REST API
* add documentation of all the API endpoints and link from here
* look at matrix switching for inspiration: https://www.home-assistant.io/components/blackbird/

#### Unplanned

* allow connecting as many amplifiers via serial ports as possible and controling through a single Bridge instance
* add support for controlling devices connected over remote IP2SL connections (Global Cache iTach Flex or [Virtual IP2SL](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/virtual-ip2sl))); useful when the Matrix Audio Bridge can't physically be connected via serial to the amplifier
* configurable "maximum volume" for each zone, which cannot be exceeded by volume control API calls
* virtual master/slave across several connected multi-zone amplifiers (including across multiple brands)
* support publishing state change events to a MQTT broker
* theoretically the Bridge's REST API, design model, and code structure could support other RS232 compatible matrix audio controller protocols (such as the Niles IntelliControl ICS GXR2), but no plans to implement
* learn from (https://github.com/koolsb/pyblackbird)
* consider generalizing this into a matrix switching controller (audio/video), supporting basics of switching sources/zones, and providing common functionality such as volume; provide raw serial command access for supporting features beyond the core
