Home Assistant add-on for [Keepalived](https://keepalived.org/) loadbalancing and high-availability virtual IPs using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). A common use case is running a DNS server on the Home Assistant host, such as [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home) or PiHole, as well as a second instance on another server.

This currently wraps the Docker Keepalived package [shawly/docker-keepalived](https://github.com/shawly/docker-keepalived), but that may change in the future if there is a more supported Docker Keepalived project.

## Support

If you have trouble with installation and configuration, visit the [HA keepalived discussion group](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/using-keepalived-in-a-hassos-installation/404185/5) to ask questions. The developers are just volunteers from the community and do not provide any support. 

If you have bug fixes or code improvements, please submit Pull Requests with your tested changes and the developers will review!

## Installation

[![Show add-on](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=f14f1480_keepalived&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frsnodgrass%2Fhassio-addons)

To install this in Home Assistant:

1. Go to the "Add-On Store" on your Home Assistant server, add this repository URL:
   
   <pre>
     https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hassio-addons
   </pre>

2. Find "__Keepalived__" in the list of add-ons and click Install

## Configuration

### Step 1: Home Assistant Setup

To setup the Keepalived HA add-on, your custom configuration file needs to exist on the Home Assistant host in `/config/keepalived.conf`.  See Keepalived docs for how to properly configure in various configurations for DNS, reverse proxies, etc.

The following  `keepalived.conf` example shows a possible configuration for a highly available DNS server cluster using the [Adguard Home add-on for Home Assistant](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home), in my case running on a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://amzn.to/3CFo8nR).

```
# /config/keepalived.conf for DNS running on Home Assistant (e.g. Adguard or PiHole DNS)

global_defs {
  router_id dns-homeassistant  # hostname is used by default
}

vrrp_instance dns_vip {
  state MASTER            # Home Assistant host is setup as primary
  virtual_router_id 53    # convention to prefer port as the vrid (53=DNS)

  priority 100            # priority on all secondary (BACKUP) must < the primary DNS server (aka MASTER)

  interface end0
  virtual_ipaddress {
    192.168.1.2/24 dev end0  # MUST match interface above (otherwise listens on ALL interfaces)
  }

  authentication {
    auth_type PASS
    auth_pass rand0m_passw0rd
  }
}

# UDP DNS lookups
virtual_server 192.168.1.2 53 {
  protocol UDP
  delay_loop 5
  lb_algo wrr # weighted round robin

  real_server 192.168.1.22 53 {
    weight 100
    DNS_CHECK {
      name example.com
    }
  }

  real_server 192.168.1.33 53 {
    weight 100
    DNS_CHECK {
      name example.com
    }
  }
}

# TCP DoH DNS lookups
virtual_server 192.168.1.2 53 {
  protocol TCP
  delay_loop 5
  lb_algo wrr # weighted round robin

  real_server 192.168.1.22 53 {
    weight 100
    TCP_CHECK {
      connect_timeout 3
      connect_port 53
    }
  }

  real_server 192.168.1.33 53 {
    weight 100
    TCP_CHECK {
      connect_timeout 3
      connect_port 53
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Confirm New Virtual IP is Exposed by Home Assistant

Once installed and running, if you go to `Settings > System > Network > Configure network interface` in Home Assistant, the IP address for any Keepalived virtual interfaces created in `keepalived.conf` should be listed.

### Step 3: Restart Any Add-Ons/Daemons That Should Listen on New VIPs

Once started, an add-on/daemon cannot listen to a new interface that is created after starting (unless it is written to proactively probe for new interfaces and start listening). For example, the AdGuard add-on cannot listen on a host's interface that doesnâ€™t exist at the time AdGuard starts up. In this case, it MUST be restarted after keepalived is running.

### Step 4: DHCP Reservation for Virtual IP to Avoid Collisions [OPTIONAL]

To avoid IP address conflicts on a LAN with DHCP setup, either set the keepalived IP address outside of the managed IP range *OR* create a DHCP reservation for a fake device MAC so that the IP address is not assigned to another device. 

For example, create a reservation for the MAC `00:00:00:DB:DB:DB` within the DHCP server for the keepalived interface. In the example `keepalived.conf` above this means creating a reservation for `192.168.1.2`.
