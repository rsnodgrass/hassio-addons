[Home Assistant add-on for keepalived](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hassio-addons/tree/master/keepalived).

This wraps the Docker Keepalived package [shawly/docker-keepalived](https://github.com/shawly/docker-keepalived), but that may change over time if there is a more supported Docker keepalived project. This is based on an older add-on by [Philipp Schmitt](https://github.com/pschmitt/home-assistant-addons) which used the no-longer maintained and many years out of date [osixia/docker-keepalived](https://github.com/osixia/docker-keepalived).

### Support

There is NO support for this add-on. Feel free to open a pull request if you want to fix any bugs and help maintain this image. Otherwise you are out of luck (for now at least).

<pre>
